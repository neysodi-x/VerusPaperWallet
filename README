# VerusCoin PaperWallet Generator CE (Community Edition)
# Copyright (C)2020 The Verus Community
--------------------------------------------------------

This software can :
- Generate VerusCoin ADDRESSES and their corresponding private key in a javascript enabled web browser, Client-side, OFFLINE (!).
- create a PaperWallet.
- show details

Tutorial :
- Use an OFFLINE, airgapped, computer;
- Open the html-page (index.html) in your browser - on your OFFLINE computer;
- after the "start message" move your mouse around to add 'hardware' randomness used to generate a new address/private key combination.

Useful for:
- The HTML file (the software) can be saved to disk and used in combination with an "OFFLINE" computer to provide good security.
- Generate a "paper wallet" by just printing the html page [again: generated on a local AIRGAPPED / OFFLINE computer] .
- Generate addresses [Private-Key / Public-Key / Public-ADDRESS]

[#] SECURITY RECOMMENDATION [ ! ! ! ]
[!]
[#] ONLY use the resulting Wallet data of this software WHEN it was generated on a airgapped computer ! :
[!] that is : a computer without internet connection (never had, never will have...).
[!]
[#] You can tryout the software on a non airgapped computer, if you do, DO-NOT use the resulting Wallet data [!].
[!]
[#] Reason for the airgapped computer:
[!] To be sure that even when you have (un)known malware on your computer;
[!] it can not send your private keys over the internet.
[!]
[#] NOTE:
[!] Just disconnecting your computer, and connecting it again after you used this software, is not enough.
[!]
[#] AGAIN:
[!] ONLY use the resulting Wallet data of this software WHEN it was generated on a airgapped computer !
[!]
[#] Stay safe! :)

This project provides an all-in-one HTML document (index.html) with embedded JavaScript/CSS.
The JavaScript is readable, not minified and contains no XMLHttpRequest 's (no AJAX) ::: Stay-safe[VERIFY]
The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded.
Meaning: there is no <script></script> inside the html that will request an external javascript file.

END USER NOTES:
-
-
- Use a modern browser :) --- NOT on a mobile-device
- Take good care of your Private-Key(s)
-
- Again : ONLY use the resulting Wallet data of this software WHEN it was generated on a airgapped computer !
-
- That said, if you DO want to use paperwallets, keep them secure... also secure from fire, water, etc.
